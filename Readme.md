# MultipleRowAdapter

Multiple row adapter is a library for android that allows you to add multiple types of rows into a recyclerview.

# Installation.

The first step is to add jitpack as repository in your project, open your root build.gradle file and add the following line in repositories section:

```kotlin
repositories {
    ...
	maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}
```

The next step is to add the library as dependency, open your build.gradle file in your app module as follows:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.raag:MultipleRowAdapter:0.5beta'
}
```
